Here’s a sample README.md file for your project. This README will explain the setup, usage, and any dependencies that need to be installed.

AR Clothing Try-On Demo

This is a simple AR (Augmented Reality) Clothing Try-On demo where users can try on virtual clothing items (e.g., a ring or skirt) in real-time using their webcam. The app integrates MediaPipe for pose detection and Three.js for 3D rendering.

Features

	•	Try on clothing items (ring, skirt) by interacting with buttons on the store page.
	•	Camera feed is displayed in the AR try-on page, enabling real-time virtual clothing placement.
	•	Buttons for adding the item to the cart or saving it for later, with toast notifications indicating success.
	•	3D model placement is based on the user’s body landmarks (e.g., wrist for the ring, waist for the skirt).

Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites

	•	Node.js (For running the project on a local server if needed)
	•	A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AR-Clothing-Try-On-Demo.git
cd AR-Clothing-Try-On-Demo


	2.	Install dependencies (if any):
For this demo, there are no additional npm dependencies, but if you are using any build tools, you might need to install them. For example:

npm install


	3.	Run the project on a local server:
To avoid issues with accessing the camera, you need to serve the files over HTTP or HTTPS. You can use Python or Node.js to serve the project locally.
	•	Using Python (if you have Python 3 installed):

python -m http.server 8000


	•	Using Node.js (install http-server globally first):

npm install -g http-server
http-server


After running the server, open your browser and visit:

http://localhost:8000


	4.	Camera Permissions:
When you load the AR Try-On page, ensure that your browser asks for permission to use the camera. If it doesn’t, check your browser settings and allow camera access for this site.

Files

	•	store.html: The store page where users can view and select clothing items.
	•	ar.html: The AR page where users can try on clothing in real-time.
	•	app.js: Main JavaScript file responsible for setting up the AR functionality, camera feed, and item rendering using Three.js.
	•	three.min.js: The minified version of the Three.js library used for 3D rendering.
	•	style.css: Basic styling for the application, including UI for the store and AR pages.
	•	index.html: The homepage (could be redirected to store.html).

Features

	•	AR Clothing Try-On: Once you click “Try On” for an item, it will display on the AR page, where the camera feed will show and render the selected item onto the body based on detected landmarks.
	•	Toast Notifications: After adding items to the cart or saving them for later, a small toast message will appear at the bottom-right corner.
	•	Camera Feed: The AR page will load the webcam feed and show it in real-time.

Troubleshooting

	•	Camera Permissions: Make sure that your browser has permission to access the camera. If you see a “Permission Denied” error, ensure your browser settings are correct.
	•	AR Models Not Showing: Ensure your browser supports WebGL (Three.js relies on WebGL for 3D rendering).
	•	AR Doesn’t Start: The camera should automatically start when you enter the AR page. If it doesn’t, check for any errors in the browser console.

Built With

	•	Three.js: 3D rendering library for creating interactive graphics in the browser.
	•	MediaPipe: Used for real-time pose detection to place clothing on the body.
	•	FBXLoader: Loader for importing FBX models into Three.js.

Notes

	•	Customize the store.html page with product information and other interactive elements.
	•	Ensure that all models (like ring_model.fbx and skirt_model.fbx) are in the correct directory (/assets/models/).
	•	To improve the performance, consider optimizing the FBX models used in the project.
